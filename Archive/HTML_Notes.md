### Radio Buttons
HTML radio buttons are a type of HTML forms used to enable website visitors to select a single option from a list of multiple options. HTML radio buttons create round check buttons next to the text.

They are created using an \<input> element whose type attribute is specified with a value of radio. Every HTML radio button must have a similar name attribute to create a neat looking picture.

Example
``` 
<form>
  <input type="radio" name="day" value="monday" checked>Monday<br>
  <input type="radio" name="day" value="tuesday">Tuesday<br>
  <input type="radio" name="day" value="wednesday">Wednesday
</form>
```
