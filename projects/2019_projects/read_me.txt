Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.

Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.

Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.

Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.

Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again.

Start coding.
